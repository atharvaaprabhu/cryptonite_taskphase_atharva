# printing variables

```bash
hacker@variables~printing-variables:~$ echo $FLAG
pwn.college{0lpIYlvmc4JyMcX8T91jUPRM20O.ddTN1QDLzATN0czW}
```

as we had learnt previously, the echo command just print whatever we tell it to print. but as shown later, the $ symbol prints whatever the variable is holding.
it said to retrieve the flag from the FLAG variable and to read the content of the variable i use the echo $FLAG command
