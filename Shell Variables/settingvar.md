# setting variables 

```bash
hacker@variables~setting-variables:~$ PWN=COLLEGE
You've set the PWN variable properly! As promised, here is the flag:
pwn.college{oPZrpsER36bWNyGPWZyNdau1E_i.dlTN1QDLzATN0czW}
```

as told, i ensured that the variables were entered correctly and were capitalised and made sure not to enter a space on either side of the '='.
