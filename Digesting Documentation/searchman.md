# searching manuals

```bash
As given n is used to go back, q is used to exit out of the page, arrow keys are used to navigate and / is used to search for certain keywords.

Using man challenge and then /flag, we find that the --vaxhl gives us the flag.

The flag is pwn.college{McAH3nLLdMTy61nrTP_2uKw9lrE.dVTM4QDLzkDN0czW}.
