# interrupting processes

```bash
hacker@processes~interrupting-processes:~$ /challenge/run
I could give you the flag... but I won't, until this process exits. Remember, 
you can force me to exit with Ctrl-C. Try it now!
^C
Good job! You have used Ctrl-C to interrupt this process! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{4SkUagix0MdEl3K3XBW9YpVWT5b.dNDN4QDLzATN0czW}
```

used ctrl c to interrupt the process and then executed /challenge/run
