# Position Thy Self

```bash
hacker@paths~position-thy-self:~$ cd /sys
hacker@paths~position-thy-self:/sys$ /challenge/run
Correct!!!
/challenge/run is an absolute path, invoked from the right directory!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{ERVGr0XgTdFNZDP2Mi4mdwqc8fj.dZDN1QDLzATN0czW}
```
understood that i had to change to the sys directory once i tried executing the /challenge/run command initially.
